# SVG Logo Maker

Week 10 Challenge - Create a SVG logo generator using user inputs

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a user generated SVG logo maker that would take a series of parameters from the user and apply them to a .svg file to create a logo. I created this project to get further experience in using command line prompts as well as create a testing suite for my application. This project has made me more familiar with the syntax of using the jest and inquirer packages along with beginning to understand svg syntax. Through this project I have learned additional applications for inquirer and the importance of creating testing suites for command line applications.
